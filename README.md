# Bootcamp-Project-1

# Description

- Our concept for project 1 is a music database that draws information from the Youtube and Bandsintown   APIs.

- Allows users to create and account to gain access to their profile add comments, likes and also save     favorite videos.

# Motivation

- Ability to pull music videos from youtube and display them on the page based on search.

- Information on different artists is pulled from Bandsintown.

- User interaction involves a section where comments, reviews, ratings, and the ability to create and     save playists/favorite(s) video(s) can be       saved by the user.

- Ability for user to create an account in order to store this information.

- A live feed feature that displays most recent comments/ratings/reviews on searched artists. 

# Results

- We were able to GET a response from the AJAX call from both API keys which deploys properly.

- We were also able to create a firebase Authentication/Database that populates the users email and     account settings when creating an account on the application, that also functions properly.

# Team Efforts

- My team and i worked together and sheared task amongs eachother to achieve our goal.

# Individual Responsibilities

- I was giving the task of working on the back end part of the application, which includes writing functions that holds the create users account settings, where users get to (sign up/ create account profile /sign in/ forgot password/ add comments/ save playlist, favorite videos) and most of these i achieved through initializing app with Firebase Authentication and Database.

     * My challenges with the Firebase app initialization was not being able to get users to see thier information on thier profile after creating an account, and as far as the favourite videos, because we encountered multiple problems with the youtube api key and literally got it working again at the last munite.
 
 # Improvements
 - Will improve app by learning more details on the firebase documentation on how to append datas from the firebase database app to the browser and also using the firebase storage to store videos that can also be pushed back to the browser as users saved favorites videos, and also to apply moment.js to the application so that users comments can be seen at exact time comment was been made.
